RISC-V is an instruction set architecture (ISA), which comes from the
University of California, Berkeley. Those instructions can be used to build a
processor. Since the RISC-V is a free and open ISA, people are not required
to apply any patents to design a processor chip. With the aid of the RISC-V,
everyone can customize and fully utilize their own chip, without wasting any
space or energy for extra function or extra storage that are designed by other
companies. Nowadays, many products are required to use microprocessor to
do some basic and efficient functions in an embedded system, in general
computing and in advanced high-performance computing, companies and
researchers are therefore actively involved in the RISC-V community.

7In addition, the RISC-V simplifies the processor design. Only a few
instructions are required to build a simple processor. So, the RISC-V
architecture is suitable for students and someone who is not experts in
processor design.
